        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The inspiration for Threadwise stemmed from a common observation: in busy enterprise forums, vital customer questions were too often getting buried or overlooked, leading to user frustration and missed opportunities for support. We recognized the growing backlog and the significant manual effort internal teams expended trying to keep pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began with a hands-on approach. We meticulously sifted through forums, identified unanswered questions, and personally nudged the right experts. The impact of these direct, timely interventions was immediate and clearâ€”engagement improved, and questions got answered. This initial, manual phase, while not scalable, was invaluable. It proved our core belief that targeted interventions work and provided the foundational insights that led to the development of Threadwise Insights Hub, an automated, intelligent solution to systematically address this challenge for organizations of all sizes.
