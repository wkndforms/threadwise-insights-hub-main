          The inspiration for ForumScout stemmed from a common observation: in busy enterprise forums, vital customer questions were too often getting buried or overlooked, leading to user frustration and missed opportunities for
          engagement. This gap in service highlighted a need for a smarter, more proactive approach to community management.
